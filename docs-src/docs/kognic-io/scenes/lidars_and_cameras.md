A `LidarsAndCameras`  consists of a _single_ frame which contains 1-9 cameras images as well as 1-20 point clouds. For more documentation on what each field corresponds to in the `LidarsAndCameras` object please check the section related to [Scene Overview](/docs/kognic-io/overview).

```python reference

:::tip Use dryrun to validate 
Setting `dryrun` parameter to true in the method call, will validate the scene using the API but not create it.
