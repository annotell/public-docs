title: Cameras Sequence
---

A `CamerasSeq` input consists of a sequence of camera images, where each frame can contain between 1-9 images from different sensors. For more documentation on what each field corresponds to in the `CamerasSeq` object please check the section related to [Input Overview](/docs/kognic-io/overview).


```python reference
https://github.com/annotell/kognic-io-examples-python/blob/master/examples/cameras_seq_images.py
```

:::tip Use dryrun to validate input
Setting `dryrun` parameter to true in the method call, will validate the input using the API but not create any inputs.
