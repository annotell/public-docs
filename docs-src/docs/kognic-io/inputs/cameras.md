title: Cameras
---
A `Cameras` input consists of a single frame of camera images, where the frame can contain between 1-9 images from different sensors. For more documentation on what each field corresponds to in the `Cameras` object please check the section related to [Input Overview](/docs/kognic-io/overview).

```python reference

```

:::tip Use dryrun to validate input
Setting `dryrun` parameter to true in the method call, will validate the input using the API but not create any inputs.
