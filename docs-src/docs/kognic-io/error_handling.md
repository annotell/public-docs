When the client sends a http request to the Input API and waits until it receives a response. If the response code is `2xx` \(the status code for a successful call\) the client converts the received message into a python object which can be viewed or used. However if the Input API responds with an error code \(`4xx` or `5xx`\) the python client will raise an error. It's up to the user to decide if and how they want to handle this error.
