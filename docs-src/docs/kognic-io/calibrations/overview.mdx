Scenes including both a 2D and 3D representation such as `lidars_and_cameras` deal with data in a number of different 
[coordinate systems](../coordinate_systems.md). These scenes require a calibration that relate the different sensors to
each other in terms of location and orientation. The calibration should also contain the required information for 
projecting 3D points into the image plane of the camera.

A `Calibration` object consists of a set of key-value pairs where the key is the name of the sensor (i.e. sensor name) 
and the value is either a `LidarCalibration` object or any of the different camera calibrations.

:::tip reuse calibration
Note that after a calibration has been created you can, and should, reuse the same calibration for multiple scenes if possible.

## Types of calibrations

All calibration types contain information about the position and orientation of the sensor in 3D. This is relative to
the reference coordinate system. More information about lidar calibrations can be found [here](lidars.md). The calibration also contains information about mapping 3D points to the
image plane of the camera. For cameras, we support different types of [standard camera calibrations](cameras-standard.md), where you only
have to provide the intrinsic parameters of the camera. If your camera model is not supported, you can also provide
a [custom camera calibration](cameras-custom.md) where you provide the implementation in the form of a WebAssembly module.

## Creating calibrations

Calibrations are created by providing a dictionary where the keys are the sensor names and the values are the calibration objects. 
An example of how to create a calibration for a LIDAR sensor and two camera sensors is shown below. 
Note that the contruction of the calibration objects is not shown here, but can be found in [kognic-io-examples](https://github.com/annotell/kognic-io-examples-python/tree/master/examples/calibration).


```python
from kognic.io.client import KognicIOClient
from kognic.io.model import SensorCalibration

from examples.calibration.create_kannala_calibration import unity_kannala_calibration
from examples.calibration.create_lidar_calibration import unity_lidar_calibration
from examples.calibration.create_pinhole_calibration import unity_pinhole_calibration

client = KognicIOClient()

calibrations = {
  # Note that the sensor names must match the names of the sensors in the scenes that use this calibration
  "lidar": unity_lidar_calibration(),
  "CAM1": unity_pinhole_calibration(),
  "CAM2": unity_kannala_calibration()
}

sensor_calibration = SensorCalibration(external_id="Collection 2020-06-16", calibration=calibrations)
created_calibration = client.calibration.create_calibration(sensor_calibration)
print(f"Created calibration with id {created_calibration.id}")
```

The retrieved calibration id is unique and should be referred to when creating scenes that use this calibration.

## Listing calibrations

Existing calibrations can be fetched with the retrieved id or with the provided external id. 
This can either be done via the client in Python or via `kognicutil`.
