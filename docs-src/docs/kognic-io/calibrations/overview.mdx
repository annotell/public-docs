Scenes with 2D and 3D data across various [coordinate systems](../coordinate_systems.md) need **calibration** to align sensors by location and orientation.
This includes projecting 3D points onto the camera’s image plane.

## Types of calibrations

All calibrations detail a sensor’s 3D position and orientation relative to the reference system.
They also map 3D points to the camera’s image plane. For more about lidar calibrations, see [here](lidars.md).

For cameras, we support different types of [standard camera calibrations](cameras-standard.md), where you only
have to provide the intrinsic parameters of the camera.

:::tip Unsupported camera model
If your camera model is not supported, you can also provide
a [custom camera calibration](cameras-custom.md) where you provide the implementation in the form of a WebAssembly module.
:::

## Creating calibrations

Calibrations are created by providing a dictionary where the keys are the sensor names and the values are the calibration objects.
An example of how to create a calibration for a LIDAR sensor and two camera sensors is shown below.
Note that the contruction of the calibration objects is not shown here, but can be found in [kognic-io-examples](https://github.com/annotell/kognic-io-examples-python/tree/master/examples/calibration).

```python
from kognic.io.client import KognicIOClient
from kognic.io.model import SensorCalibration

from examples.calibration.create_kannala_calibration import unity_kannala_calibration
from examples.calibration.create_lidar_calibration import unity_lidar_calibration
from examples.calibration.create_pinhole_calibration import unity_pinhole_calibration

client = KognicIOClient()

calibrations = {
  # Note that the sensor names (i.e. "lidar", "LEFT_FRONT_CAMERA" etc) must match the names of the sensors in the scenes that use this calibration
  "lidar": unity_lidar_calibration(),
  "LEFT_FRONT_CAMERA": unity_pinhole_calibration(),
  "RIGHT_FRONT_CAMERA": unity_kannala_calibration()
}

sensor_calibration = SensorCalibration(external_id="Create your own id here", calibration=calibrations)
created_calibration = client.calibration.create_calibration(sensor_calibration)
print(f"Created calibration with id {created_calibration.id}")
```

The retrieved calibration id is unique and should be referred to when creating scenes that use this calibration.

:::tip reuse calibration
Note that after a calibration has been created you can, and should, reuse the same calibration for multiple scenes if possible.
:::

## Listing calibrations

Existing calibrations can be fetched with the retrieved id or with the provided external id.
This can either be done via the client in Python or via `kognicutil`.

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    # Fetch calibration by id
    client.calibration.get_calibration("e95980c4-fee2-4b91-9316-1bffbcb5a896")

    # Fetch calibration by external id
    client.calibration.get_calibrations(external_id="Collection 2020-06-16")
    ```

  <TabItem value="kognicutil" label="kognicutil" default>
    ```bash
    # Fetch calibration by id
    kognicutil calibration --id "e95980c4-fee2-4b91-9316-1bffbcb5a896"

    # Fetch calibration by external id
    kognicutil calibration --external-id "Collection 2020-06-16"
    ```
