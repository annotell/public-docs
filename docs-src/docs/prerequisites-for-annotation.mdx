# Prerequisites for Annotation

Before scenes can be annotated a few things need to be in place. From a developer perspective there is not too much to do;
this is mostly organization and workforce level preparation, but it is good to be aware of the process.

<details>
  <summary>
    <h2 style={{margin: '0px'}}>Projects and Requests</h2>
  </summary>

A scene is sent for annotation by adding it to a *Request*, creating what we call and *Input*, which has its own UUID.
This is detailed on the next page.

The request is part of a *Batch*, itself part of a *Project*. Projects and initial Requests and Batches will be set up,
possibly in conjunction with Perception Experts from Kognic, during the onboarding/setup phase for new customers.
They may also be managed independently or in conjunction with a BPO who provides annotation services through the Kognic platform.

  <summary>
    <h2 style={{margin: '0px'}}>Annotation Types</h2>
  </summary>

Annotation types are a niche part of the configuration but the concept appears in the API and library so it is important to know about them.

Annotations types are configured on a project, and a subset of those on each request. Every input produces an output *Annotation* (the final deliverable) for each annotation type.

In the majority of cases there will be a single annotation type, so one scene is annotated in a request to produce one *Annotation*, or set of labels.

If the use of multiple annotation types is relevant to your use-case, Kognic will work with you to understand how to use them further.

<details>
  <summary>
    <h2 style={{margin: '0px'}}>Taxonomies</h2>
  </summary>

The taxonomy defines the "what" of annotation: what is there to annotate, and hence what does the resulting annotation describe?
The classes of object and the domain and range of their properties, plus annotatable properties of the scene.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h2 style={{margin: '0px'}}>Annotation Instruction</h2>
  </summary>

In essence, the Annotation Instruction defines the arrangements for the annotation process itself: for example that
polylines are to be drawn to label lane markings.
</details>

Projects, Requests, Taxonomies and Annotation Instructions are not required to exist or be completely configured in order to upload scenes.
However, the relevant configuration must have been completed in the Kognic Platform before scenes can be added to requests, and hence before they can be annotated.
