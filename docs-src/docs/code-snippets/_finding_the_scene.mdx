The `scene_uuid` returned in the response can be used to refer to the scene in the future. For example, you can find the scene again either in the Kognic Platform or via the Python client:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="platform" label="Kognic Platform" default>
    Go to the [Data Orchestration tab](https://app.kognic.com/data-orchestration) in the Kognic Platform and search for the scene by its UUID or use any other suitable search criteria.
    In the `status` column you can see the status of the scene and if it is ready, you can view it by clicking on the link provided when opening the menu. 
    
    Note that you may need to contact Kognic to get access to _Data Orchestration_ in case you do not see it.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
    Use the `get_scenes_by_uuids` method to get the scene object:
    ```python
    scene = client.scene.get_scenes_by_uuids([scene_uuid])[0]
    ```
    The scene object will contain the status of the scene and a view link if the scene is ready.
    ```python
    print(f"Scene {scene.uuid} has status {scene.status}")
    print(f"View the scene at {scene.view_link}")
    ```
  </TabItem>
