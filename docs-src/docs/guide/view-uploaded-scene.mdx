# View an uploaded scene

Once a scene has been created, and we have processed it, it is possible to view it in the annotation tool (without annotation capabilities).

## Find the view link

Every scene has a view link that allows it to be viewed in the annotation tool, without any annotation capabilities.
You can find the scene again either in the Kognic Platform or via the Python client:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="platform" label="Kognic Platform" default>
        Go to the [Data Orchestration tab](https://app.kognic.com/data-orchestration) in the Kognic Platform and search for
        the scene by its UUID or use any other suitable search criteria. Once it is ready, you can view it by clicking on
        the link provided when opening the menu. It may take a short time for the scene to transition from "processing" to "ready".

        Note that you may need to contact Kognic to get access to _Data Orchestration_ in case you do not see it.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
        Use the `get_scenes_by_uuids` method to get the scene object, and then access its `view_link` attribute, which
        is populated once the scene is ready.

        ```python
        scene = client.scene.get_scenes_by_uuids([scene_uuid])[0]
        print(f"View the scene at {scene.view_link}")
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Check calibration of 3D scenes

3D scenes (those with LiDAR/RADAR) require a calibration, which can be checked for accuracy when viewing the scene.
Start by opening the scene view link as described above.

 <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="python" label="2D (Camera) View" default>
         In the 2D view you can overlay the projected pointcloud onto the camera images.

        - Click on the "2D" button at the top left of the scene view
        - Open the "View" menu, then "Pointcloud overlay" and then "Depth"
        - Compare the overlaid points with the features of the image.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="3d-view" label="3D (Pointcloud) View" default>
        In the 3D view you can compare where specific 3D points end up when projected into 2D.

        1. Click on the "3D" button at the top left of the scene view
        2. Find a well defined object in the pointcloud and hover the mouse cursor over a point on it.
        3. The cursor position is projected into the selected camera and shown as a dot on the camera thumbnail at the top right.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Calibrations are immutable
If you detect a calibration error this way, it is necessary to recreate the scene with a corrected calibration.
It is therefore a good idea to check a few scenes before uploading a large dataset that all use the same calibration.
