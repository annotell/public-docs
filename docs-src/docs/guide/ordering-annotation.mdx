# Ordering Annotation

As outlined on the previous page, annotation requires various configuration to have been completed in order for scenes to be turned into annotations.

Ordering annotation is very simple once you are familiar with the basics of creating a scene via the Kognic IO Client.

## Inline with scene creation (new scenes)
When creating a scene, you can also specify the request to add it to, and an input will be created as soon as scene is ready.

It is also possible to add the scene to another request later on, re-using it for annotation in multiple requests

For complete information, refer to [Working with Scenes & Inputs, Creating Inputs Directly](./kognic-io/working_with_scenes_and_inputs#creating-inputs-directly)

## Separate from scene creation (existing scenes)

If a scene is created without specifying a request, it will be created but not sent for annotation. 
The scene can then be sent for annotation by adding it to one or multiple requests at any point later on.

For complete information, refer to [Working with Scenes & Inputs, Creating Inputs from Scene](./kognic-io/working_with_scenes_and_inputs#creating-inputs-from-scene)
