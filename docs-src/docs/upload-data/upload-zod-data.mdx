This tutorial will guide you through uploading different [scene types](docs/kognic-io/overview.md#different-types-of-scenes) using the Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD).
The purpose of this page is to show you some of the steps that might be needed to convert recordings into Kognic scenes.

  <summary><h2>Prerequisites & Dependencies</h2></summary>

1. To follow along in this guide you need to download the data from [Zenseact Open Dataset](https://zod.zenseact.com/download/). The data should be structured like this:
```
zod
├── sequences
│   ├── 000000
│   ├── 000002
│   ├── ...
└── trainval-sequences-mini.json
```
2. You will also need to install the ZOD Python package from PyPI, which provides some abstractions for reading the data:
```
pip install zod
```
3. You need to have a Kognic account and the Kognic Python client installed. If you have not done this yet, read the [quickstart guide](getting-started/quickstart.mdx).

This guide follows the process of uploading scenes using ZOD data, using the example code from
<a href={ref('examples/zod')}>the Kognic IO ZOD examples repository</a> which contains the complete source files for all
of the snippets in this page. The examples are runnable, if you have the data available and have Kognic authentication
set up.
