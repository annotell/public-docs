# Quickstart

Kognic provides HTTP APIs to our client-facing services and API client libraries to simplify calling APIs from
Python. [kognic-auth](https://pypi.org/project/kognic-auth/) handles authentication while [kognic-io](https://pypi.org/project/kognic-io/) 
wraps basic API calls and simplifies calling the APIs from Python code. Depending on your use case, you may use one or both of these libraries. 
This guide will cover how install these libraries and how to set up and verify your credentials.


## Installation

Installation can be done via pip:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="kognic-io-installation" label="kognic-io" default>
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade kognic-io
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kognic-auth-installation" label="kognic-auth" default>
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade kognic-auth
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that `kognic-io` uses `kognic-auth` under the hood for authentication so you only need to install `kognic-io` if you plan to use it.


## Setup and verify credentials

Generate and download credentials from the Kognic Platform according to [this](./kognic-apis#generating-credentials) guide. 
Then you can set the environment variable `KOGNIC_CREDENTIALS` to point to it. Assuming that you saved your credentials in `~/.config/kognic/credentials.json`, 
you can do this by running the following in the terminal
```bash
export KOGNIC_CREDENTIALS=~/.config/kognic/credentials.json
```
To verify that they are correct you can simply list projects in Python:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="kognic-io-verify" label="kognic-io" default>
    ```python
    from kognic.io.client import KognicIOClient

    client = KognicIOClient()
    client.project.get_projects()
    print("success")
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kognic-auth-verify" label="kognic-auth" default>
    ```python
    from kognic.auth.requests.auth_session import RequestsAuthSession

    client = RequestsAuthSession()
    client.session.get("https://input.app.kognic.com/v1/projects").raise_for_status()
    print("success")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now be set up to interact with the Kognic Platform.
